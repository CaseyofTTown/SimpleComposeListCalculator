I created this app with the idea that someone would use it as they walked through the store, keeping track of the total price of the contents in their 
shopping cart so they arent suprised when they hit the checkout aisle. Click on releases to download the APK and install the file, your phone may say 
unable to install at first until you give it permission to install unkown apps from the internet and not just the playstore. After you give it permission, 
your phone may request/suggest you scan the app with play protect, this is fine as theres nothing in the application that would cause it to fail. After that
it should install and youll be able to use the application, just as if it had came from the Google Play store, I just simply no longer maintain a developer
account with them. Cheers and reach out if youd like for me to build some software for you.
